# 11-3. Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should
# take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these
# as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5, 000 to the
# annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.
# Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_default
# _raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t
# have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run your test
# case, and make sure both tests pass.
